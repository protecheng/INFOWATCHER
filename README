InfoWatcher - A log/system monitoring and filter program originally based on swatch2.2 
(Simple Watcher)

UPDATES

1.11-
    Condensed the three routines that read from the config file into 1.  Also
    Found that alarm () does not work correctly for implementing a timeout when 
    trying to access a hung FS.  Replaced with routine set_timeout which implements
    a timeout usint SIGINT.  Added another error level to messages.  Also fixed 
    a couple bugs.

1.10-
    Added the companion program slm.pl to check processes, hosts,
    file systems, and FDFs.  The overall set of programs is now called "InfoWatcher".

1.02-
    Changed Debug 3 to a command line option for Single_Pass.  Fixed an error
    where messages were not getting mailed correctly. Fixed the mode problem
    in the install scripts.

1.01- 
    Fixed the point at which the time stamp is added to the messages.  This
    was necessitated by the interval modifications.  Added a Debug level 3 to
    give an admin the ability to make a single pass through all monitored files.
    Couple minor cleanups.

1.0-
    Finally fixed the way in which the program handles intervals within
    skip_message().  Also added in an option to set a minimum # of messages 
    to be received within an interval before the messages are reported.

0.5-
    Several bug fixes and minor modifications.

0.4-
    This is Version 0.4 of slm.  It has been modified to handle dated
    log files, to do more checking to ensure no messages are missed, and to
    trim its own log based on receiving a SIGALRM at a specified time, or
    when the file reaches 500KB.  Also added debugging levels instead of 
    a simple flag.

0.3-
    This is Version 0.3 of slm.  It has been modified to run as a daemon
    process and its main module no longer spawns a second process.  It has 
    also had several modifications made to the logging and message formats
    It also contains several documentation fixes.  Special thanks to Sean 
    Murphy (SRA) and Chris Murphy (RABA Inc.) for their reviews and 
    suggestions.

0.2- 
    This is Version 0.2 of slm.  It modularizes the original program
    and adds several bug fixes and enhancements.

0.1-
   This is the first version of slm.  It builds on the swatch program
   to monitor multiple files instead of a single file.
